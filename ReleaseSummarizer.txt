Name of the Idea: Automated Release Code Change Summarization  

Description: Automate the analysis and summarization of code changes in production releases using GitHub Actions and Gemini AI to improve communication and production stability.

Identifying changes in a release requires checking Jira stories tagged to the release's fix version, but many are unaware that they can check Jira features for the fix version to understand release changes.
Understanding actual code changes through Jira stories' descriptions or acceptance criteria is time-consuming.
Code changes in PRs often do not match the descriptions in the tagged Jira stories due to manual errors.
Many are unaware that they can check Jira features for the fix version to understand release changes.
Test coverage issues may arise as testers might miss critical changes not accurately reflected in the Jira stories.
